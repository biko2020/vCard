The application is now running on http://127.0.0.1:8000. However, to make it accessible from other machines, you'll want to bind it to all interfaces:

python3 app.py --host=0.0.0.0

Or for production deployment:

gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app


Firewall Configuration You'll need to open port 8000 on your machine. On most Linux systems, you can do this with:

sudo ufw allow 8000/tcp  # For UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
# or
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=8000/tcp  # For FirewallD
